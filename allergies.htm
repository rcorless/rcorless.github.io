<h4>Allergy list</h4m
<p>My allergies are complicated 
  enough that even I forget, sometimes. Here is the list as of October 2021.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Peanuts, walnuts and all other nuts (except macadamias, almonds, pine nuts, 
    cashews (!) and chestnuts).</li>
  <li>Soya beans, protein or protein isolate (soya sauce is ok, as is teriyaki 
    sauce, as is soy lecithin or soy oil---in all of these last, the proteins 
    are processed or fermented right out.  Some home-made or high-end soy sauces cause trouble.). Soya flour and soy protein isolate cause me the 
    most difficulty of all my allergies---they put SPI on many cold cuts of meat 
    nowadays <i>to make it look better when they add water</i>.  My nephew Tom cynically suggests that it's really to make it weigh more.</li>
  <li>Lentils, chickpeas, peas, snow peas, etc. Ordinary garden peas I can eat 
    if they are raw, but I am quite allergic to lentils and chickpeas. But beans 
    are fine.  So, I guess I am allergic to pulses. </li>
  <li> Couscous. </li>
  <li>Raw egg (hardboiled, fried or scrambled, overdone souffles and omelets are 
    all fine---but not chocolate mousse, for example, or some kinds of ice cream)</li>
  <li>Raw oatmeal (This one is weird and occasional.  Maybe only some kinds of oatmeal?).</li>
  <li>Alfalfa sprouts.</li>
  <li>Bananas.</li>
  <li> Overripe avocado (this one bothers me as I love avocado and guacamole and used to eat it anyway).  I think it's the pit I am really allergic to.</li>
  <li>Some kinds of beer, especially Heineken (I don't know why). I don't regret 
    the Heineken, but some of the exotic Belgian beers are another story. I am 
    allergic to wheat beers (weise) as well.</li>
  <li>Some molds, and therefore many moldy cheeses (including, alas, Stilton).  Luckily I can eat brie.</li>
</ol>
  
Non-food allergies.
<ol>
  <li> Dust mites.  Hoo boy this is a bad one nowadays. </li>
  <li> Cats, especially Abyssinians.  And most dogs. </li>
  <li> Many pollens from various trees, and ragweed of course. </li>
  <li> A surprising number of scented products. Especially some perfumes. </li>
  </ol>
<h4>What happens to me if I eat something I am allergic to:</h4>
<p>My lips, tongue and mouth swell up and itch; if I have eaten enough of something 
  I am quite allergic to (say hummus) I will feel nauseous and my throat will 
  be closed and painful---but it is a purely local reaction, not anaphylactic; 
  and my reactions have been decreasing over time. Usually the swelling occurs 
  within 3 minutes of my sampling something, and I have developed the habit of 
  eating only a small taste to start, and waiting. Then I just stop eating it, 
  and am usually fine even without medication. I use an oral antihistamine for 
  the times when I am hit with SPI, lentils or peanuts.  Peanuts are the worst: a half a peanut will make me ill for hours.  I do carry an EpiPen but have never used it.</p>
<p>So if you have to be allergic to something, this is the kind of allergy to 
  have---fast enough to know when to stop eating, and slow enough not to kill 
  you.</p>
