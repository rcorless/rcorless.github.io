<H4> Maple Transactions </H4>
I am the Editor-in-Chief for <A HREF="http://www.mapletransactions.org"> Maple Transactions </A>, a new open-access scholarly journal.  The purpose of Maple Transactions is to disseminate excellent expositions on topics of interest to the Maple community.  There are no page charges, and you need not use Maple to be published in this journal.

<H4> My current obsession: Bohemian Matrices </H4>

<p><A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_matrices"> The Wikipedia entry on Bohemian Matrices </A></p>



<H4> My new book, with Neil Calkin and Eunice Chan! Open access, and in beta: comments welcome! </H4>

Chapter 4 (or is it Unit 4?  With a Jupyter Book the old words for divisions of a book are a bit obsolete) covers Bohemian matrices at an entry level.

<h4> Research Interests </h4>

<p></p>
<p>I have three major overlapping research areas: computational dynamical systems, computational algebra, and computational special functions, each of which is used in scientific and engineering applications. 
<!---The applications I and others have used my work for include flow-induced vibration of artificial structures, financial options, cardiac simulations, and the kinetics of dark adaptation in the human eye.  --->
My main overall concern is for the fidelity and reliability of these algorithms in actual applications. 
<!--- Of course, everyone wants to solve problems quickly, but no-one wants this at the expense of unreliable predictions. --->
The main approach that I use is <A HREF="https://github.com/rcorless/rcorless.github.io/blob/main/CMTpaper.pdf">Computer-Mediated Thinking</A> or <em>Computational Discovery</em>, or <em>Computational Epistemology</em>. 
That link goes to a paper describing that idea in a <em>teaching</em> context, but it is a much broader idea, namely that the combination of human plus computer, especially equipped with thin slices of Artificial Intelligence, can be better than the human alone. 
<!--- Obviously this <em>might</em> be true, but making sure that it <em>is</em> true is harder, and more important, than it looks. --->
