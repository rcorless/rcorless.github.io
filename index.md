<!--- ## In 1995 you often saw web pages marked "under construction".  --->

<!--- Let's see how long it takes me to finish the first draft in 2021; it's now 12 February, 2021. 

Ok, first thing is that we need a picture. ![Image](P1080174.JPG)

Ok, that worked.  Now to mine my old web pages.  

OMG: I found an html container for an *Altavista* search!  It had options to search "The Web" or "USENET" !

Other pieces of cruft (generated by *Pagemaker* in 1998) are now coming to light.  

I can feel a total redesign coming on.

<h4> Research Interests </h4>

<p></p>
<p>I have three major overlapping research areas: computational dynamical systems, computational algebra, and computational special functions, each of which is used in scientific and engineering applications. 
<!---The applications I and others have used my work for include flow-induced vibration of artificial structures, financial options, cardiac simulations, and the kinetics of dark adaptation in the human eye.  --->
My main overall concern is for the fidelity and reliability of these algorithms in actual applications. 
<!--- Of course, everyone wants to solve problems quickly, but no-one wants this at the expense of unreliable predictions. --->
The main approach that I have use is <A HREF="https://github.com/rcorless/rcorless.github.io/blob/main/CMTpaper.pdf">Computer-Mediated Thinking</A> or <em>Computational Discovery</em>, or <em>Computational Epistemology</em>. 
That link goes to a paper describing that idea in a <em>teaching</em> context, but it is a much broader idea, namely that the combination of human plus computer, especially equipped with thin slices of Artificial Intelligence, can be better than the human alone. 
<!--- Obviously this <em>might</em> be true, but making sure that it <em>is</em> true is harder, and more important, than it looks. --->

<p>My channel includes some talks, and some course videos. I'm still learning, but making the videos is quite fun! There will be more.</p>
