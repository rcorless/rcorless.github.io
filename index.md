<H4> My current obsession: Bohemian Matrices </H4>

See <A HREF="https://www.bohemianmatrices.com"> bohemianmatrices.com </A> for details.  But here's an image, just for a teaser.

![A density plot in the complex plane of the Bohemian eigenvalues of a sample of 73 million 5x5 matrices where the entries are sampled from the set {-20, -1, 0, 1, 20}. Color represents the eigenvalue density. Viewed on -40 <= x,y <= 40. Image credit Steven E. Thornton.](Geometric_5x5.jpg)


<h4> Research Interests </h4>

<p></p>
<p>I have three major overlapping research areas: computational dynamical systems, computational algebra, and computational special functions, each of which is used in scientific and engineering applications. 
<!---The applications I and others have used my work for include flow-induced vibration of artificial structures, financial options, cardiac simulations, and the kinetics of dark adaptation in the human eye.  --->
My main overall concern is for the fidelity and reliability of these algorithms in actual applications. 
<!--- Of course, everyone wants to solve problems quickly, but no-one wants this at the expense of unreliable predictions. --->
The main approach that I use is <A HREF="https://github.com/rcorless/rcorless.github.io/blob/main/CMTpaper.pdf">Computer-Mediated Thinking</A> or <em>Computational Discovery</em>, or <em>Computational Epistemology</em>. 
That link goes to a paper describing that idea in a <em>teaching</em> context, but it is a much broader idea, namely that the combination of human plus computer, especially equipped with thin slices of Artificial Intelligence, can be better than the human alone. 
<!--- Obviously this <em>might</em> be true, but making sure that it <em>is</em> true is harder, and more important, than it looks. --->
